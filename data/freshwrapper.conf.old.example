# Configuration options for FreshPlayerPlugin with libconfig8

# This configuration file is optional. Wrapper will search for it first
# in ~/.config/freshwrapper.conf, then in /etc/freshwrapper.conf.
# If wrapper fails to find configuration, it will use default values,
# which you can find below

# Audio buffer is used to continuously provide sound adapter with data.
# Values too low may lead to buffer underruns and stuttering.  Values
# too high will lead to noticeable latency. Usually plugin selects size
# on its own, but you may override bounds here

# your machine doesn't have it, there would be no sound, and no sync

# Path to the Pepper Flash plugin.
# If the option is absent, freshwrapper will search for Pepper Flash in
# a number of location where it could be. Usually that's enough, but if
# not, you should manually enter the right path. Multiple paths could
# be specified, separated by colon.

# if zeros are used here, freshwrapper will select minimal width and
