# Configuration options for FreshPlayerPlugin

# This configuration file is optional. Wrapper will search for it first
# in ~/.config/freshwrapper.conf, then in /etc/freshwrapper.conf.
# If wrapper fails to find configuration, it will use default values

# Audio buffer is used to continuously provide sound adapter with data.
# Values too low may lead to buffer underruns and stuttering.  Values
# too high will lead to noticeable latency. Usually plugin selects size
# on its own, but you may override bounds here

# lower bound for audio buffer size, in milliseconds
audio_buffer_min_ms = 20

# higher bound of audio buffer size, in milliseconds
audio_buffer_max_ms = 500

# Xinerama screen used to acquire fullscreen window geometry
xinerama_screen = 0

# Path to the Pepper Flash plugin
pepperflash_path = "/opt/google/chrome/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so"

# "Command-line" arguments for Flash
flash_command_line = "enable_hw_video_decode=1,enable_stagevideo_auto=1"

# experimental: enable 3d and stage 3d
exp_enable_3d = 0
