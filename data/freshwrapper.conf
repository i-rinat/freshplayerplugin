# Configuration options for FreshPlayerPlugin

# This configuration file is optional. Wrapper will search for it first
# in ~/.config/freshwrapper.conf, then in /etc/freshwrapper.conf.
# If wrapper fails to find configuration, it will use default values,
# which you can find below

# Audio buffer is used to continuously provide sound adapter with data.
# Values too low may lead to buffer underruns and stuttering.  Values
# too high will lead to noticeable latency. Usually plugin selects size
# on its own, but you may override bounds here

# lower bound for audio buffer size, in milliseconds
audio_buffer_min_ms = 20

# higher bound of audio buffer size, in milliseconds
audio_buffer_max_ms = 500

# Path to the Pepper Flash plugin
pepperflash_path = "/usr/lib/pepperflashplugin-nonfree/libpepflashplayer.so"

# "Command-line" arguments for Flash
flash_command_line = "enable_hw_video_decode=1,enable_stagevideo_auto=1"

# enable 3d and stage 3d
enable_3d = 0

# enable 3d for wmode=transparent instances
enable_3d_transparent = 1

# when set to 1, limits output to warnings and errors only
quiet = 0

# When multiple monitors with different resolutions are used, size
# of fullscreen window can vary. But some Flash movies request these
# parameters once at startup and rely on them to be correct. By default,
# if zeros are used here, freshwrapper will select minimal width and
# height across all monitors.

# Enables DNS query case randomization to partially protect against DNS
# poisoning attacks. It was reported that some Mikrotik routers do not
# support this trick. Set parameter to 0 if you have an affected model
